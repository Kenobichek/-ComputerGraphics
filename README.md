# ComputerGraphics
lab1


Familiarize yourself with the capabilities of OpenGL, with the principles of building a two-dimensional coordinate system. Using the selected graphics library, draw a creature based on primitives. Using the library that is responsible for the system level of input-output operations - to implement the movement of the creature. Control keys - ADWS

lab2
1) Get acquainted with the principles of building a three-dimensional coordinate system.
2) Build a scene consisting of three objects: two basic shapes and a plane. We believe that the center of the plane coincides with the center of the scene, and the figures are located at an equal distance on both sides of it.
2.1) In accordance with your option, display basic library objects on the screen in the form of a frame and in the form of a solid object. Set two different fill colors.
2.2) Create a surface from vertices using the functions glVertexPointer and glVertex3f, according to the function of your variant
3) Using the gluLookAt command and key processing functions, create a moving camera for the depicted objects. (We move the camera around the center of the scene - full rotation in the horizontal and vertical planes)
4) Obtain images of objects in orthogonal and perspective projections using the functions glOrtho, glFrustum, gluLookAt (switching between projections is programmed to press the "P" and "O" keys, respectively).
At the same time, it is necessary to take into account that object matrices and displays must be selected directly by the glMatrixMode command and pre-normalized by the glLoadIdentity function.
